// Design and implement a class called Sphere that contains instance data that represent a sphereâ€™s diameter.
// -   Define a Sphere constructor to accept and initialize the diameter.
// -   Include getter and setter methods for the diameter.
// -   Include methods to calculate and return the volume and surface area of the sphere.
// -   Include a toString method that returns a one-line description of the sphere.
// -   Create a driver class (main class) called MultiSphere, whose main method instantiates and updates several Sphere objects.
